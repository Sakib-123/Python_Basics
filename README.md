- Navigate to the repository: `cd Python-Basics`
- Explore the various directories containing code snippets and projects.

## Code Examples

The `code_examples` directory contains simple Python scripts and snippets covering a range of topics. Each file is self-contained and focuses on a specific concept or feature. Feel free to browse through and use them as references.

## Projects

In the `projects` directory, you'll find more comprehensive Python projects that I've implemented to reinforce my understanding of the language. Each project is organized into its own directory with a dedicated README file providing details and instructions.
